# Objective
Build and deploy a web application which lists all the pilots who recently violated a NDZ (no drone zone) perimeter

Persist the pilot information for 10 minutes since their drone was last seen by the equipment

Display the closest confirmed distance to the nest (middle of no drone zone)

Contain the pilot name, email address and phone number

Immediately show the information from the last 10 minutes to anyone opening the application

Don't require the user to manually refresh the view to see up-to-date information
