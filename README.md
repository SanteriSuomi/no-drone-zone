Reaktor job application assignment

Deployed at https://no-drone-zone.vercel.app/

# Objective
Build and deploy a web application which lists all the pilots who recently violated a NDZ (no drone zone) perimeter.

Persist the pilot information for 10 minutes since their drone was last seen by the equipment
Display the closest confirmed distance to the nest (middle of no drone zone)
Contain the pilot name, email address and phone number
Immediately show the information from the last 10 minutes to anyone opening the application
Not require the user to manually refresh the view to see up-to-date information
Develop the application as if it was always operational. However, for the sake of staying within free tiers of some hosting providers, it's OK if your application is suspended and loses data after it has not received traffic for a while. It'll be given a moment to warm up and gather new data before being evaluated.
